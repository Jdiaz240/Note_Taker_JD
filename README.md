Completed By Joshua Diaz

## Project description:

In this project we were assigned to create a working note taker app using express, and deploy on heroku. In using the application you will see that you can add a note as well as a title and save it as well. After hitting the save button the new note will be saved to the pages left side and added to a list of saved notes.
